      <h1>About the Alcove Shows</h1>
      <p>
        When the New Mexico Museum of Art was established in 1917, our building
        and its Pueblo Revival style of architecture were designed by I. H. and
        William M. Rapp to celebrate the historic qualities unique to our state.
        The institution itself was created to exhibit artwork contemporary to its
        time. Many of the artworks and artists who exhibited at that time now form
        the historic core of our permanent collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        To celebrate the 100th anniversary of New Mexico's statehood, and in
        anticipation of the New Mexico Museum of Art's centennial, we presented a
        year-long cycle of alcove exhibitions. The format of these Alcove Shows
        can be traced back to the 1917 founding of the Art Gallery of the Museum
        of New Mexico. Small one-person exhibitions were held in the gallery
        alcoves through the 1950s, resuming in the mid-1980s and again in the
        early 1990s. Alcove 12.0 continues this tradition with a series of nine
        exhibitions featuring the work of 45 New Mexico artists.
